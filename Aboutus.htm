                        <strong>Our thoughts</strong><br />
                        <br />
                        "She stared blankly at the blackboard, her eyes showing confusion mixed with fascination.
                        The blackboard had few English words, scribbled by myself. “Bhaiya (big brother),
                        What do they mean?” her trembling words faintly reaching my ears. Chunni Lal is
                        among the few fortunate girls in the state Bihar, India who has got the opportunity
                        to get formal education. There are still a million other girls in the state who
                        have been denied the right to obtain education by their families. My tenure as a
                        teacher in the Nari Gunjan School, Patna.India proved to be a spiritual ride for
                        me. The experience during summer holidays opened my eyes and I could see the harsh
                        reality outside the well equipped and furnished classrooms of my school. A population
                        over a million is illiterate in Bihar, my native place in India. “I was getting
                        married but, I wanted to study. Now, I want to become a doctor.” says a 13 year
                        old Shanti who belongs to one of the most underprivileged caste in India. Her ancestors
                        had to suffer unspeakable hardships due to the prevalent caste discrimination atmosphere.
                        It took a hard time for the school’s headmistress to convince her parents who had
                        little faith in education. “Why should I sent my daughter to school, she is almost
                        12 now and ready for marriage”, says the adamant mother of Munni. Convincing the
                        parents is even more challenging. They have strong preconceived notions formed by
                        years of struggles and hardships. Persuading some of the local villagers proved
                        to be very challenging for me. They had rigid thoughts and unwavering stance about
                        school and education but I did not give up and was able to convince a handful of
                        parents about the importance of education and gave some strong reasons for sending
                        their kids especially the girls to school. At the end of the day all I had was satisfaction,
                        I gave myself a pat on the back, it was a tough day and I did well. Moreover, I
                        had enhanced my persuasion skills. My enlightening experience in the previous summer
                        further solidified my stance on the importance of imparting education to the public,
                        especially the ones suffering from poverty and financial hardships. I strongly believe
                        that education at the grassroot level can eradicate some of the reasons limiting
                        India’s growth. I now sincerely devote some of my time going to various places around
                        my native city to teach English in newly established schools or schools lacking
                        adequate teachers. It has developed me as a person, I have become more compassionate
                        and understanding to people around myself. Seeing people suffering around myself,
                        I feel responsible for their situation. Why responsible? Simply because I have neglected
                        my responsibly for my selfish needs. This understanding has profoundly changed my
                        thinking, my perception."
